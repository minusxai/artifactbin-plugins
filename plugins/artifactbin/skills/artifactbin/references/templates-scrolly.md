## Read first

Playful scrollytelling — a pudding.cool-style data story with a conceit, ticker bands, and chapter breaks.

Curious, witty, second-person — and DRESSED UP: the story wears a costume (a mission console, a field report, a race broadcast) and every element plays along. The scroll IS the story, suspense lives between chapters, and fun, visual stunningness is the point — serious about the data, theatrical about everything else. The costume itself can run deadpan (a technical console, straight-faced) or full broadcast — pick the register the subject can carry.

Beats: Console hero / cold open (the conceit announces itself) → Ticker band → Chapters (3-5), each opened by a page-break band → Twist → Payoff → Methodology footer

Voice, second person: "you'd expect X — that's not what happened". The humor is in the
telling, never at the data's expense.

THE CONCEIT (the biggest lever): invent the fiction the data lives inside and
commit EVERY element to it — the console's name, chapter labels in its voice, figure
numbers, status chips, timestamps. One conceit, total commitment.

Type register: the utility face IS the conceit's voice — `font-mono text-xs uppercase
tracking-widest` on ALL labels; display shouts the two-tone claims, condensed and huge;
body stays in short bursts.

Skeleton (one pass of the beats; the costume here is a traffic monitor — wear your own):

## Rules

THE FUN KIT (compose 4-6 per story; pace them, never all on one screen):
- Console topbar: it scrolls away; fixed and sticky are banned.
- Two-tone headline: THE one word of the claim in the accent — hero on
  `animate-fade-up`, chapter headlines on `reveal-up`.
- Ticker band: a full-bleed accent strip of repeating key stats that SCROLLS — the
  skeleton's two identical spans are what makes the -50% marquee loop seamless, and
  `[animation-duration:20s]` tunes the speed. A section seam, once or twice.
- Scroll reveals: `reveal-up` on the chart slab, staggered stat cards
  (`[transition-delay:120ms]`, `240ms`) — one per chapter. Captures and reduced-motion
  viewers see the page finished.
- Drawn motif: a small inline `<svg>` in the conceit's voice, `currentColor` strokes,
  local `url(#id)` refs only. Motion beyond the kit: class-scoped,
  reduced-motion-guarded `@keyframes` in the document's `<style>{`...`}</style>` block,
  never fighting a utility (utilities are !important).
- Page-break band: the skeleton's inverted strip plus a GIANT ghost chapter numeral
  (15% opacity, accent) bleeding off one edge.
- Stamped section label: the chapter kicker and its italic aside are ONE flex row,
  full-width ABOVE the headline — never in their own grid column.
- Hard-shadow chart slab: an OFFSET SOLID shadow, no blur, alternating the accent and
  foreground tokens per chapter; each closes on the dashed-top spec strip — `FIG.02 ·
  WHAT IT SHOWS` left, accent annotation right.
- Dashed stat cards: `border-dashed` cards, a giant accent single-value embed with arrow
  notation for change ("3,253 → 129", a suffix in the embed's columnFormats, still live). Stagger a row.
- Chip row of key facts under the hero; a blueprint-grid texture (`bg-[size:48px_48px]`
  over a `linear-gradient`) on quiet sections; an accent drop cap per chapter.

STRUCTURE: three to five chapters instead of one, dashed stat cards beside
the chart slab (`@3xl:grid-cols-[3fr_2fr]`). The TWIST chapter breaks the pattern —
inverted ground, or the evolving chart: re-embed the SAME question
across steps with progressive `viz` overrides (gray, then one series accented, then the
domain zoomed) — the platform's scrolly scene, no sticky needed.

Only the BANDS run full-bleed (ticker, page-break, inverted twist); chapter content stays
in the centered `max-w-6xl` shell. Every chapter opens the same way — band, label row,
headline; the twist is the one sanctioned break.

BALANCE: split a chapter only when both columns carry comparable height — prose one side,
evidence the other. If one cell would hold just a label or a lone stat, stack it above.

Do
- Alternate dark/light grounds between chapters.
- Direct-label the thing being followed; captions do jokes AND work.
Don't
- Fake sticky scenes; walls of prose; two conceits; a payoff without its number.
