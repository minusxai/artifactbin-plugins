## Read first

Upload a self-contained document, get back a **link** to share with your user.

- **Publish** is one `POST https://artifactbin.dev/api/artifacts` with `{ "title", "markup" }`
  (+ optional `theme`, `template`, `colorMode`); the deliverable is the `url`.
- **Every `/api` call, `GET` included, sends `Authorization: Bearer mx_...`.**
  No token? `POST https://artifactbin.dev/api/tokens/anonymous` returns one; a pasted start
  link answers `{"token"}` when `POST`ed once. Saved config, claiming, scope,
  the 401: [auth.md](auth.md).
- A document is **static JSX**, not HTML: HTML tags plus a component kit,
  under the JSX rules — every tag closes (`<br />`), comments are `{/* … */}`,
  no `<html>`/`<head>`/`<body>` (`<title>`, `<style>`, `<script>` go in
  `<Helmet>`), style with `className`: [../markup/SKILL.md](../markup/SKILL.md).
- Datasets, images and chart recipes are their own artifacts, created first:
  [datasets.md](datasets.md). Pinned feedback: [annotations.md](annotations.md).
  History, revert, delete, PNG export: [versions.md](versions.md). MCP: [mcp.md](mcp.md).

## Rules every document lives by

A document is served sandboxed with an opaque origin under a strict
per-document Content-Security-Policy: **no outbound network except the four
same-origin endpoints its own CSP names** — `/a/<id>/query` (its data),
`/a/<id>/events` (its live stream), `/a/<id>/mutate` (its declared writes)
and the `/geojson/` boundaries the map charts read. So: ONE self-contained
document — no CDN `<script src>`, no external stylesheet, no `fetch`/XHR
beyond those four (a 400 at publish; a runtime `fetch()` elsewhere is
blocked silently); CSS and JS in `<Helmet>` only; an image is a `data:` URI,
a `ref:<id>`, or an `https://` URL IMPORTED at publish; a web font names a
Google family in a `<Helmet>` `<meta>`. Max 2,000,000 bytes.

## Endpoints

### Create an artifact

```
POST https://artifactbin.dev/api/artifacts
{ "title": "Optional title", "description": "Optional", "markup": "<h1 className=\"text-4xl font-bold\">Hello</h1>" }
→ 201 { "id": "<6-char id>", "url": "https://artifactbin.dev/a/<id>", "version": 1, "visibility": "public", "edit_id": "<head pointer>", "markup_changed": false }
```

`markup` is one of four content fields — `markup | dataset | viz | image`;
every endpoint takes exactly ONE. Give `url` to your user — the deliverable.
Every write answers `markup_changed`: true means storing rewrote the document
(formatting normalized, a `<Helmet>` hoisted to the top, a `<p>` holding
block content turned into a `<div>`) and the CANONICAL `markup` comes back;
false means it stored unchanged, byte-for-byte. Edit against the echo. (`/edits` always
returns the resulting `markup`: you sent a splice.)

**Visibility (who can open that url).** An account-owned token publishes
`private` by default — **when your user wants a link for OTHER people, pass
`"visibility": "public"` or `"unlisted"` on create or PUT.** `public` =
anyone with the link, listed on the owner's `/@username`; `unlisted` = the
same link, listed nowhere; `private` = the owner plus emails invited on the
share page (as an **editor**, or a **commenter** who may annotate but not
edit) — a document shared with your user is reachable by every route below
as if they owned it. Anonymous tokens publish `public`, images and datasets
`unlisted`; `private` without an account is `400 private_requires_account`,
never a silent downgrade.

### Update an artifact (the link never changes)

```
PUT https://artifactbin.dev/api/artifacts/<id>
{ "markup": "<h1 className=\"text-4xl\">Replaced</h1>", "title": "optional new title" }
→ 200 { "id", "url", "version": <bumped> }
```

Also the place for metadata: `"folder": "2026/08/reports"` (segments
`[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`, max 8 deep; the URL keeps working) and `"visibility"`.

Full replacement — send the complete new content, not a diff; the previous
version is archived. Omitted `title`/`description` keep their values.
Optionally include `expectedVersion` (from your last read): a concurrent edit
then answers `409 {"error":"version_conflict","currentVersion":N}` instead of
being overwritten — re-read, merge, retry with `expectedVersion: N`.

### Edit part of a document (preferred for `markup`)

```
POST https://artifactbin.dev/api/artifacts/<id>/edits
{ "edit_id": "<from your last read>", "old_string": "exact text to replace", "new_string": "replacement" }
→ 200 { "id", "version", "edit_id": "<new>", "markup", ... }
```

Like editing a file: `old_string` must appear EXACTLY ONCE in the version
named by `edit_id`. Prefer this over PUT: it is smaller, and a HUMAN MAY BE
EDITING THE SAME PAGE LIVE. `edit_id` is an opaque string returned by every
create/read/edit — never invent one; it is how the server knows which version
you read. Concurrency is per NODE, not per document, so most edits just apply:

| Result | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `200` | Applied — even if someone edited a DIFFERENT part meanwhile | Use the returned `edit_id` next |
| `409 doc_changed` | Someone changed the SAME part | Re-anchor on the returned `edit_id` + `source`, retry |
| `409 stale_edit_id` | That `edit_id` is unknown (too old, or never read) | `GET` the artifact, start from its `edit_id` |
| `400 bad_diff` | `old_string` matched zero times or more than once | Pick a longer unique anchor |

You may also set `title`, `theme`, or `colorMode` in the same request, with
or without a text change: they are document-level and never conflict.

### Read one back (before editing)

```
GET https://artifactbin.dev/api/artifacts/<id>
→ 200 { "id", "url", "title", "description", "format", "markup", "version", "edit_id",
        "annotations": [ ... ], "open_annotations": <count>, ... }
```

### List your artifacts

```
GET https://artifactbin.dev/api/artifacts
→ 200 { "artifacts": [ { "id", "url", "title", "format", "version", "updated_at", ... } ] }
```

EVERYTHING you own — datasets, images and viz recipes are artifacts too, each
with its `format`; there is no separate datasets endpoint.

## Errors

| Status | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | `invalid_json` / `markup_only` / `one_of_markup_dataset_viz_image` / `invalid_jsx` / `invalid_refs` / `invalid_sql` / `unknown_theme` | Fix the body — `details` names each problem with its span (`invalid_sql`: the engine's message and candidate columns) |
| 400 | `invalid_visibility` / `private_requires_account` | `visibility` is `public`, `unlisted` or `private`; `private` needs an account-owned token |
| 400 | `public_not_enabled` | This deployment does not offer `public`; use `unlisted` (already anyone-with-the-link) |
| 400 | `invalid_folder` | `folder` segments are `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]` (max 40 chars each, 8 deep) |
| 401 | `unauthorized` | Token wrong/revoked — ask your user, don't retry |
| 403 | `quota_exceeded` | This token is at its artifact cap — delete something, or use another token |
| 404 | `not_found` | No artifact with that id is reachable by your token |
| 409 | `version_conflict` | Your `expectedVersion` is stale — re-read, merge, retry with `currentVersion` |
| 409 | `doc_changed` | Someone edited the SAME node — re-anchor on the returned `edit_id`/`source`, retry |
| 409 | `stale_edit_id` | That `edit_id` is unknown — `GET` the artifact, use its `edit_id` |
| 400 | `bad_diff` | `old_string` matched zero times or more than once — pick a unique anchor |
| 400 | `invalid_annotation_action` | The annotation POST needs `reply`, `resolve: true` or `reopen: true` |
| 400 | `image_fetch_failed` | An `https://` image could not be imported (unreachable, not an image, private address, over the cap) — `details` names it |
| 403 | `dataset_read_only` | The `<Mutation>` target must be your own dataset with `"access": "readwrite"` |
| 409 | `has_dependents` | Other documents reference this artifact — re-send DELETE with `?force=true` |
| 413 | `too_large` | Shrink the content |
| 429 | `rate_limited` | Back off and retry after a minute |
