## Read first

artifact-bin: publish self-contained documents (reports, dashboards, decks, datasets, charts, images) and share the returned URL with your user — that url is the deliverable.

Quick rules:
- Every artifact takes exactly ONE content field: markup | dataset | viz | image.
- markup is THE document format: static JSX over the component kit, plain HTML tags for everything else (prose included), and ONE top-level <Helmet> for <title>/<style>/<script>. There is no separate markdown or html tier.
- Create dataset/viz/image artifacts first. A dataset is read by SQL — <Query name="q">{`select … from ref_<id>`}</Query> in <Helmet>, bound as data="$q"; images and recipes bind as ref:<id>.
- update_artifact fully replaces content at a stable URL; every save is versioned and revertible; edit_artifact changes one node and needs the edit_id from your last read.

Before authoring, read the docs over plain HTTP (no auth needed) — small files, critical content at the top of each:
- https://artifactbin.dev/docs/artifact-bin/SKILL.md — the brief: everything a straightforward document needs. Read it first.
- https://artifactbin.dev/docs/artifact-bin/references/markup.md — the document vocabulary; markup-data.md beside it is the data grammar in full.
- https://artifactbin.dev/docs/artifact-bin/references/templates-<name>.md and …/themes-<name>.md — AFTER picking a template and a theme, the chosen one in full.
- https://artifactbin.dev/docs — the whole tree listed with a one-line "when to read" per file.

## The MCP server

`https://artifactbin.dev/mcp` — a Streamable HTTP MCP server speaking this exact API
(`create_artifact`, `update_artifact`, `edit_artifact`, `get_artifact`, `list_artifacts`, `list_versions`, `get_version`, `revert_artifact`, `delete_artifact`, `annotate`, `mutate_dataset`, `export_artifact` — one tool per operation, from the same registry the HTTP routes run).
It supports OAuth: add it with no credentials and the client pops a browser
where your user logs in with their email (a one-time code — no password) and
approves. Artifacts published through the connection belong to that account:

```
claude mcp add --transport http artifact-bin https://artifactbin.dev/mcp
```

Already have an `mx_` token? Skip the browser: pass it as a header instead
(`--header "Authorization: Bearer mx_..."`) — the tokens are interchangeable.
The HTTP reference in [publishing.md](publishing.md) doubles as the tools' semantics:
content tiers, the edit protocol, and what each error means.
