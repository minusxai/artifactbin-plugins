## Read first — everything a straightforward document needs

Publish with one call — the response carries the `id` and the `url` to hand over:

```
create_artifact({ "title": "…", "markup": "…", "theme": "industry", "template": "deck" })
```

Every write answers `markup_changed`: true = storing rewrote it (formatting,
a hoisted `<Helmet>`, a `<p>` holding a block) and the canonical `markup`
rides back — edit against that. A 400 names exactly what to fix. The deliverable is `https://artifactbin.dev/a/<id>`.
**`title` is what a browser tab and link previews show** — always set it; the
on-page heading is not it.

**The MCP connection is already authenticated — every call is a tool call; there is no token to manage.**

**Editing a published document** — send the CHANGE, not the whole file. `get_artifact` returns the current `markup` and an
`edit_id`; pass that `edit_id` back with the exact text to swap:

```
edit_artifact({ "id": "<id>", "edit_id": "…", "old_string": "exact text once in the document", "new_string": "replacement" })
```

`old_string` must appear EXACTLY ONCE. Prefer it over replacing the whole
document: smaller, and a human may be editing the same page live.

**markup** is JSX treated as data: ordinary HTML tags for everything including
prose (`h1 h2 p ul li blockquote table figure img`, inline `svg`) plus the
component kit (`Card`, `Tabs`, `Badge`, `Grid`/`GridItem`,
`SlideDeck`/`Slide`, `Icon`, and the data embeds `Question`,
`DataTable`, `Number`), styled ONLY with Tailwind utilities via
`className` — inline `style=` is rejected. There is no markdown.

**Guess rather than look up.** An unknown HTML tag is refused with a 400
carrying the whole allowed set (`allowed_html_tags`), an unknown component the
registry — a wrong guess costs one cheap round trip. One exception:
`script, iframe, object, embed, base, meta, link, form, frame, frameset, applet, noscript` are refused outright with NO list — never guess
them (`<form>`, `<iframe>`, `<meta>` are the common mistakes). Custom CSS
and JS live in ONE `<Helmet>`, which also holds `<title>`:

```jsx
<Helmet><title>What the tab shows</title><style>{`:root { --primary: #ff6a1f }`}</style></Helmet>
```

**A document is a CONTAINER, and a reader may be on a phone (390px).** Use
container prefixes — `@2xl:`, `@3xl:` — never the viewport ones
(`sm:`/`md:`/`lg:` do not apply). Multi-column layouts start at
one column and widen: `grid-cols-1 @2xl:grid-cols-3`, and so does display
type — `text-4xl @2xl:text-6xl`, never a bare `text-6xl` (60px type breaks a
phone). Never a fixed pixel width.

Rules a document lives by: one self-contained document — no CDN `<script src>`,
no external stylesheet (hard 400s at publish); a runtime `fetch()` elsewhere
is blocked by the sandbox; images are a `data:` URI or
an `https://` URL (imported at publish); web fonts: a Google family via
`<meta name="font-display" content="Lobster" />`.

**Data in a document** — three moves: upload the rows, declare a `<Query>` over
them inside the `<Helmet>`, bind an embed by `$name`. The rows are their own
artifact (`{"dataset":"month,revenue\n2026-01,120"}`); its create response
echoes a ready-to-paste Query+Question.

```jsx
<Helmet><Query name="sales">{`select region, sum(revenue) revenue from ref_<datasetId> group by 1`}</Query></Helmet>
<Question data="$sales" viz={{"kind":"vega-lite","spec":{"mark":"bar","encoding":{"x":{"field":"region","type":"nominal"},"y":{"field":"revenue","type":"quantitative"}}}}} />
```

`<DataTable data="$sales" />` tables the same rows; a reader control
(`<Select value="$region" options="$regions" />`) writes into a `<Value>` and
re-runs its queries live. **For ANY dataviz — charts, KPIs, tables, controls —
read `references/markup-data.md` first, and ALWAYS chart with these embeds,
never a hand-rolled `<svg>` chart**: `<Question viz>` speaks full vega-lite,
and the kit adds theme palettes, tooltips, responsive sizing and live re-runs
for free.

**theme** — the palette and fonts; author with token classes
(`bg-background`, `text-muted-foreground`) and it follows:

- `modernist` — Stark Swiss editorial — white and near-black with one red accent, inverted to ink-black in dark
- `organic` — Warm, soft, playful — sage green, terracotta, leafy chart tones
- `industry` — Professional, square — slate and industrial blue, safety-orange for the one exception
- `terminal` — Terminal — mono type throughout, near-black with neon green by default
- `manuscript` — Serif editorial — cream paper, sepia ink, oxblood accent
- `pop` — Playful and loud — candy magenta, cyan and amber over near-white, chunky radii, heavy Bricolage Grotesque headings

`colorMode`: `light` | `dark`.

**template** — the structural genre. Pick by the ask; deviating deliberately
is first-class:

- `deck` — slides for PRESENTING: one idea per slide, ~40% empty space.
- `dashboard` — an operating view: `<Grid>` tiles wall to wall, KPI numbers as
  the only big type, almost no prose.
- `editorial` — a report or long read: ONE centered `max-w-2xl` column,
  numbered `<h2>` section claims. For artifacts with lots of text.
- `scrolly` — data stories (pudding-style) and fun use cases: one conceit the
  whole page commits to, chapter bands, evidence revealed on scroll. The
  strongest default when none of the above fit.

**The reading path — before writing, read in order:**
`references/design.md` (the craft), `references/markup.md` (the full
vocabulary), then as needed the `references/templates-<name>.md` and
`references/themes-<name>.md` you picked — the frame and skeleton there are
what make it come out right (a deck without its frame ships text flush to the
viewport edge). Other references as needed — data/dataviz adds
`references/markup-data.md`, annotations/comments
`references/publishing-annotations.md`.

A successful tool call already validated the document. `export_artifact`
returns it as a PNG (`slide: 2` for one deck slide, 1-based) — call it only if
you can actually view images; otherwise re-read the markup with `get_artifact`.

**Prose, sections and a one-dataset chart are fully covered above** — for a
quick job this sheet is the whole thing; anything more follows the reading
path. Beyond both, each ask has ONE file under `references/` (all beside this file under `references/`):
| when the ask involves | read |
|---|---|
| the API in full — full replace, `expectedVersion`, visibility & sharing, the error table | `publishing.md` |
| tokens — minting without a link, saved config, claiming, a 401 | `publishing-auth.md` |
| uploading data — CSV/sheet/URL rows, images, viz recipes, refresh warnings | `publishing-datasets.md` |
| pinned human feedback — reply, resolve, the anchor attribute | `publishing-annotations.md` |
| connecting an MCP client — OAuth or bearer, the tool list | `publishing-mcp.md` |
| history — versions, revert, delete, export options | `publishing-versions.md` |
| design craft — hierarchy, type, spacing, color, motifs | `design.md` |
| the complete tag + component allowlists, `<Helmet>` in depth, layout rules | `markup.md` |
| dataviz & charts (vega specs), controls, writable datasets, `<Mutation>`, formats | `markup-data.md` |
| scroll reveals and ambient motion classes | `markup-motion.md` |
| video embeds — the click-to-open card | `markup-video.md` |
| inline SVG motifs and the allowed subset | `markup-svg.md` |
| a long/intricate genre piece — act structure, full skeleton | `templates-<name>.md` (index: `templates.md`) |
| the picked theme — tokens, accent class, chart palette | `themes-<name>.md` (index: `themes.md`) |
Open ONE — the files sit under `references/` beside this skill (`grep -rl <term> references/` finds the owner).
