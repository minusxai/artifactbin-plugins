## Read first

Typeset document/report — one centered text column paced in pages by a repeated folio rule, with numbered figures as the only wide elements.

A printed document rendered on screen: a white paper, a memo to the board, a report you could hand across a desk. One quiet centered column of measured prose, paced in PAGES — every section opens under the same folio rule as if a fresh sheet were fed in — and numbered figures (Vega charts, drawn SVG diagrams, images) do the showing. Minimal is the register: hairlines, small caps, and numbers; the restraint is what reads as authority.

Beats: Title block (masthead rule · title · standfirst · byline/date) → Summary (hairline-bounded, bold-lead findings) → Numbered sections (3-6, one claim each, each opening on a fresh page and closing on a takeaway) → Figures throughout (FIG-numbered — chart, diagram, or image) → Closing section (the so-what) + method footer

Voice: a document, not a webpage. Section headlines are numbered CLAIMS in sentence case
("2. Retention paid for the price increase"), set quiet (`font-semibold tracking-tight`)
— reading only the headlines delivers the whole argument. The body is measured prose:
short paragraphs, no dangling one-line sections.

Skeleton (one pass of the beats):

## Rules

THE OUTLINE: three or more `<h2>` sections get a platform-built table of contents beside
the column on wide screens — keep the headings short enough to read in a list. Nothing
to author.

Type register: display carries the title and the numbered claims, quiet and tight; body
carries the prose at `leading-relaxed`; the utility face carries the apparatus — masthead,
folio lines, § and FIG numbers, table digits (`font-mono` where the theme bundles one, small caps
always tracked).

THE COLUMN (the whole layout): everything lives in ONE centered text column. CHARTS and diagrams are the single sanctioned exception — they may
widen, always symmetrically (`@3xl:-mx-24`, up to `-mx-40` for a wide chart), so they
stay centered on the column's own axis. A TABLE never widens: it sits in the column and
hugs its rows (the platform makes every table its own scroll box), taking `w-full` only
when its rows want the whole measure.

PAGE BREAKS (spend them generously; every new idea gets a fresh page): a numbered section
opens with the SAME folio line every time, verbatim — generous air above
(`mt-24 @2xl:mt-32`), the skeleton's running-header rule (`Doc title` / `§ 02`), then
`mt-14` before the headline. Break hygiene: a figure and its caption never separate, and a
heading never sits at the foot of a page — move the break, not the caption.

FIGURES (aim for one per section). Every figure is a `<figure>` with a FIG-numbered
`<figcaption>`, numbered continuously across the document. Four kinds:
- Chart: `<Question data="$q" viz={{"kind":"vega-lite","spec":{…}}} height="380px" />`
  over a `<Query name="q">{`select … from ref_<datasetId>`}</Query>` declared in
  `<Helmet>` — Vega for every chart; quiet grays, ONE accented series, direct labels over
  legends. Evidence 380-440px; a lone number 170-220px.
- Diagram: an inline `<svg>` drawn in `currentColor` strokes at hairline weights. Local
  `url(#id)` refs only.
- Image: `<img src="ref:<imageId>" />`, or an `https://` URL — a remote image is IMPORTED
  at publish (fetched once, stored) and rewritten to `ref:<id>` for you.
- Table: a plain `<table className="text-sm">` in the column, with its FIG caption, but
  never widened (see THE COLUMN).
Caption grammar (the skeleton's classes): `FIG. 02` — one sentence stating what the
figure proves, at the data's precision.

TAKEAWAYS (in the column, never a rail, never a box):
- Section close: after the last paragraph, one hairline-topped line (`mt-8 border-t
  border-border pt-3`) leading `<strong>Takeaway:</strong>` — one sentence with its
  number, one per section, same register every time.
- The Summary up front is the same device aggregated: the document's 2-4 findings as
  bold-lead bullets, each with its number. State conclusions before arguing them.

Only the title block animates (`animate-fade-up`, staggered once).

Minimal, concretely: the color budget is foreground + muted + hairlines; the accent
appears only INSIDE figures. Tables are compact hairline sets (uppercase tracked `<th>`,
`tabular-nums`, row rules).

Do
- Sections and figures numbered continuously ("§ 3", "FIG. 04"); a figure in nearly every
  section, with a caption that states the finding.
Don't
- Side rails, asymmetric splits, full-bleed bands, KPI strips, boxed takeaway widgets,
  inverted grounds, alternating backgrounds, cards, shadows, rounded boxes — webpage
  furniture on what should be paper.
- Prose wider than the column; a figure widened off the column's axis; motion past the
  title block.
- Topic headlines; a section that shows nothing (no figure, no table, no number).
